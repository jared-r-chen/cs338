===== DAYTIME =====

1. TCP handshake
	1	192.168.108.128	132.163.96.6	TCP	74	37234 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=3374326993 TSecr=0 WS=128

	2	132.163.96.6	192.168.108.128	TCP	60	13 → 37234 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460
	3	0.029679343	192.168.108.128	132.163.96.6	TCP	54	37234 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0

2. Port 13, ports are used for identifying unique transactions.
3. Frame 4 → 132.163.96.6	192.168.108.128	DAYTIME	105	DAYTIME Response
4. There is a daytime protocol which holds the date time information
5. [SYN] means synchronization packet
6. [ACK] means acknowledgment packet
7. [FIN] means termination packet
8. For me the client initialed the closing of the TCP protocol because it was the first source to send a FIN tag

===== HTTP =====

1. 2 TCP connections were opened
2. The index.html request was sent on frame 7:
	7	0.048976381	192.168.108.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	396	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
3. The jeff_square_head.jpg was requested on frame 11:
	11	0.169399639	192.168.108.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	365	GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1 

===== QUESTIONS =====

1. What is the PSH tag? What packet does this refer to?
2. What is the [TCP Keep-Alive] tag mean?
3. Is there a difference between frame number and time in terms of order?
