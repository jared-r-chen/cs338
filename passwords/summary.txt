Analysis:
- The time per hash did not change by much. part 2 and part 3 have similar hash times
but part 1 was slightly slower. this was because all words were put in a dictionary with their
hash, then usernames were matched to passwords, which is a slightly different process compared
to part 2 and part 3.

- yes, there were n^2 - n more passwords to check in part 2, so finding valid passwords was way slower.
finding passwords in part 2 was 357316 times slower than in part 1. Part3 didn't even yield a single
password since there were 16^8 n passwords to check.

- For phase one we have 267751 words so we have 267751 hashs which take up about 17.13 mb after 
overhead is accounted for. for phase 2 we have 267751^2 hashes, so to store all those hashes it takes
around 4.6 tb after accounting for overhead. for part three we have 16^8 potential salts and 267751
potential passwords. In total we have 16^8 * 267751 potential passwords. Therefore for phase three it 
would take about 73.6 pentabytes to map all passwords with salts to their hashes.

- a. storng passwords as hashes means the actual password isn't known, therefore if someone
gets into the data base, they cannot access accounts on the database.

  b. the act of hashing is fast, but still takes time. saving passwords as hashes can further
slow down brute force attacks as each potential passwords needs to be hashed.

  c. The people who hace access to this data for their jobs are not necessarily trusted entities,
  hashing pervents them from viewing your password. 

  d. if the passwords are stored as hashes, hashes can be done by clients so the hash is sent across 
  the network, meaning the password never actually leaves the clients machine.
