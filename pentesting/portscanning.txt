===== passive information gathering =====
1. I investigated google.com 
2. ip: 172.217.0.174
3. domain registration expires 2028-09-13T07:00:00+0000
4. There seem to be many pieces involved with the just a domain. IANA
or Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, is part of this as they distribute
IP addresses. There is another company called VeriSign that handles customer
service, administrative, and technical needs. There is company contact information
as well as emails and addresses.

===== host detection =====
1. three ip addresses were found: 192.168.108.1, 192.168.108.2, 192.168.108.128, and 192.168.64.2.
2.  .1 doesn't seem to have a readable name but seems to be a local router according to
        the internet.
    .2 seems to be connected to the entity VMware_eb:d3:7c
    .128 seems to be connected to the entity VMware_fd:58:fd
    64.2 is the metasploitable VM
3.  .1 using port 80 and 443, .128 sends two TCP SYC to .1. .1 responds with RST, ACK
        for both SYC, if a response is recieved then .128 knows .1 is hosting.
    .2 same process as for .1, .128 sends two TCP SYC to .2, .2 responds with  RST, ACK
        for both SYC, if a response is recieved then .128 knows .2 is hosting.
    .128 it asks "who has .128? tell .2". The information about .128 is then returned to
        .2.
    64.2 using port 80 and 443, .128 sends two TCP SYC to 64.2. 64.2 responds with RST, ACK
        for both SYC, if a response is recieved then .128 knows 64.2 is hosting.


scanning a remote network
1. there were 75 hosts found with ips ending from .5 to .234.
2. each host seems to be a unique site hosted on the carleton network
3. For each host, kali performs a TCP three way handshake. After performing the handshake,
    nmap was able to get the information about the host.

===== port scanning =====
1. open ports:
    PORT     STATE SERVICE
    21/tcp   open  ftp
    22/tcp   open  ssh
    23/tcp   open  telnet`    25/tcp   open  smtp
    53/tcp   open  domain
    80/tcp   open  http
    111/tcp  open  rpcbind
    139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
    445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
    512/tcp  open  exec
    513/tcp  open  login
    514/tcp  open  shell
    1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
    1524/tcp open  ingreslock
    2049/tcp open  nfs
    2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp
    3306/tcp open  mysql
    5432/tcp open  postgresql
    5900/tcp open  vnc
    6000/tcp open  X11
    6667/tcp open  irc
    8009/tcp open  ajp13
    8180/tcp open  unknown]

2. I see open ports for mysql and postgresql which are databases that could be exploited

3. RSA key from nmap -A: 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3

4. vnc (virtual network computing) allows userers to control another computer over a network. This 
    is useful for things like remote work or collaboration, but can obviously be exploited for malicious
    purposes.
